# Hi! 

I am Xun Yang, a master student studying AI major at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [(HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Junwei Liang](https://junweiliang.me/).

My research mainly focuses on the whole body control on robots, especially robot locomotion and manipulation. I hope to enable humanoid robot to play diverse types of sports, especially basketball skills like dribbling, shooting and lay up. 

If you are interested in me, please check my [CV](https://kyrieyoung926.github.io/cv/).
