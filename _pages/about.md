# Hi! 

I am Xun Yang, a master student studying AI major at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [(HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Junwei Liang](https://junweiliang.me/).

My research focuses on whole-body control in robots, with a particular interest in locomotion and manipulation. I aim to enable humanoid robots to perform various sports skills, especially in basketballâ€”such as dribbling, shooting, and layups.

If you're interested, feel free to check out my [CV](https://kyrieyoung926.github.io/cv/).
